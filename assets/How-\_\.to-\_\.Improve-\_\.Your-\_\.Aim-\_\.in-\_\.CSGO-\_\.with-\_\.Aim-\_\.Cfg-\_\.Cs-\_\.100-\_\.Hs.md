## What is an aim cfg?
 
An aim cfg is a text file that contains a set of commands and settings that affect how your mouse and crosshair behave in CS:GO. By tweaking these settings, you can customize your aim to suit your personal preference and style. Some of the settings that an aim cfg can change include:
 
- Sensitivity: how fast your crosshair moves when you move your mouse.
- Acceleration: how much your crosshair speed changes depending on how fast you move your mouse.
- Raw input: whether your mouse input is processed by the game or by your operating system.
- Zoom sensitivity: how fast your crosshair moves when you are scoped in with a sniper rifle or other weapon.
- Crosshair size, color, style, gap, outline, and alpha: how your crosshair looks on the screen.
- Recoil control system (RCS): how much your crosshair compensates for the recoil of your weapon.
- Aimbot: a cheat that automatically aims at the enemy's head or body.

An aim cfg can help you improve your aim by making it more consistent, accurate, and comfortable. However, it is not a magic solution that will make you a pro overnight. You still need to practice your aim skills, learn the maps, and develop your game sense. An aim cfg is just a tool that can enhance your performance, but it does not replace your hard work and dedication.
 
## How to use an aim cfg?
 
To use an aim cfg, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download an aim cfg file from a trusted source. You can find many aim cfgs online, but be careful not to download any files that contain viruses or malware. One of the best aim cfgs for CS:GO is Aim Cfg Cs 100 Hs, which claims to give you 100% headshots with any weapon. You can download it from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vetQ87H39M), which also shows you how to install it and use it.
2. Copy the aim cfg file to your CS:GO folder. The default location of this folder is C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg. If you have installed CS:GO in a different location, you need to find the cfg folder there.
3. Rename the aim cfg file to autoexec.cfg. This will make the game execute the commands in the file automatically every time you launch CS:GO.
4. Launch CS:GO and enjoy your improved aim. You can also adjust some of the settings in the aim cfg by opening the console (press ~) and typing the commands manually. For example, if you want to change your sensitivity, you can type sensitivity 2.5 and press enter.

## Conclusion
 
An aim cfg is a useful tool that can help you improve your aim in CS:GO by customizing your mouse and crosshair settings. However, it is not a substitute for practicing and learning the game. You still need to work on your aim skills, map knowledge, and game sense to become a better player.
